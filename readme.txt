PREFACE
I'll start this off by saying that my original intention was to have this be able to compare unlimited files,
but due to the fact I could not get my head around using constructors and passing them in (and showing that in the GUI)
I changed it last minute to only include two files unfortunately. This was infinitely more doable.

        * I decided to seperately implement each as opposed to adding one listener
        * and then separating by source. I find this a cleaner method of implementation
        * and no documentation or debate I could find definitively said that
